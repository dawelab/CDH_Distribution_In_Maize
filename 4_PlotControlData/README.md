These scripts calculate and plot the tag index for Ab10, K10L2, and the B chromosome. 

## 4. Plot the Control Data
1. This script calculates tag index from the tag reads per million (RPM) for Ab10. It then plots the tag index across the Ab10 haplotype for all relevant controls.
2.  This script calculates tag index from the tag reads per million (RPM) for the B chromosome. It then plots the tag index across the B Chromosome for all relevant controls.
3. This script calculates tag index from the tag reads per million (RPM) for K10L2. It then plots the tag index across the K10L2 haplotype for all relevant controls.
