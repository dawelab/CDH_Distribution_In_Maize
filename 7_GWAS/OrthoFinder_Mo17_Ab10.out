Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
A duplicate accession was found using just first part: g5442.t1.2.66db4656
Tried to use only the first part of the accession in order to list the sequences in each orthogroup
more concisely but these were not unique. The full accession line will be used instead.

OrthoFinder assigned 38865 genes (88.9% of total) to 5915 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 9 or more genes (G50 was 9) and were contained in the largest 1170 orthogroups (O50 was 1170). There were 392 orthogroups with all species present and 244 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.
