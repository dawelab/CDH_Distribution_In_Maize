These scripts process the data from doi:10.1038/ng.3784 from demultiplex qualified reads to .fastq files that TASSEL can accept. TASSEL requires fastq files be named in a specific way and the reads cannot be shorter than 64 bp. 

## 1. Process data
1. Filter the qualified reads from doi:10.1038/ng.3784 to only reads that are 64 bp or longer. 
2. Run barcode faker on the length filtered data from  doi:10.1038/ng.3784 to make the data compatible with TASSEL.
   > TASSEL provides [this] (https://github.com/labroo2/rtassel_supp/blob/master/barcode_faker.R) script for demultiplexing in their [documentation] (https://bitbucket.org/tasseladmin/tassel-5-source/wiki/Tassel5GBSv2Pipeline/GBSSeqToTagDBPlugin)). I modified it to set the barcode length to 13 in order to have enough permutations of ACTG in for the large number of lines I needed to demultiplex.
3. Modify barcode faker file names to be compatible with TASSEL and all other data sources.
4. Generate the key file needed for TASSEL for all data sources. DC1 = Dawe Lab Controls 1, DC2 = Dawe Lab Controls 2, SW = Swarts et al 2017, RN = Romero-Navarro 2018, RY = Romay et al 2013. 
5. This is the final key file used
6. This makes a file with all the metadata for all the datasets. 1.6_Files includes all the files that this script loads in.
7. This is the file generated by 6
