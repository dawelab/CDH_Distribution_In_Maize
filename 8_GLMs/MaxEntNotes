How to get on:

Start an ondemand session at https://ondemand.gacrc.uga.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sessions

#Load Jaa, without this it will throw an error
Run ml Java/17.0.6

#Enter the directory with the maxent executable in it
cd /scratch/mjb51923/Ab10_Global_Survey/out/WorldClim2/maxent

#Run the maxent executable to launch the GUI
java -mx90000m -jar maxent.jar

Stand_3 :
*** This is the one I am proceeding with ***
Clipped all layers to the minimum extent possible that included all presence points (followed this tutorial  https://equatorstudios.com/how-to-clip-shapefile-in-qgis/)
Used variables selected to remove colinearity
Replicated run = subsample because I have a moderate nmber of occurances (https://groups.google.com/g/maxent/c/YqVzTIWYi1o?pli=1)
Random test percentage = 25% 
max number of background points as 15000 (to ensure that all my samples are utalized).
Replicated runs = 10
Individually clicked eached feauture type rather than auto features (https://github.com/dondealban/tutorial-qgis-maxent)
Randomized seed = TRUE
checked per species results
checked write plot data
unchecked give visual warning
checked remove duplicate presence records
projected to the rest of the world


Decissions I made:

I selected the Micro6 global climate model because chatGTP reports it is commonly used for agriculture and balances temeprature and precipitation well. 

MIROC6 or MIROC-ES2L
Strengths: Balanced performance in simulating both temperature and precipitation. Often used for agricultural applications.
Why itâ€™s good for maize: Captures both seasonal temperature changes and precipitation trends critical for maize phenology.
